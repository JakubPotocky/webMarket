All of this should run on xampp, also you need to import SQL database to ensure it all works.

Put this all of this into folder named "potockyMP" and put it into-> C:\xampp\htdocs (depends how you downloaded xampp)
Then you can open xampp and run apache and mySQL and connect to this url: localhost/potockyMP/potockyMP.php

If you have any questions regarding how to start this thing, don't hesitate to contact me at jakubpatoky@gmail.com or discord: jakubxl
